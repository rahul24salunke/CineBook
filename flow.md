# CineBook — Application Flow & Architecture

A detailed walkthrough of how CineBook works, request by request, covering the features
implemented so far: **JWT authentication** (BCrypt-hashed passwords, stateless tokens,
Spring Security) and the **partial-cancellation schema** (per-seat data model that lets a
single seat in a booking be cancelled/refunded independently).

---

## 1. High-level architecture

CineBook is a two-tier web app:

| Layer | Technology | Port |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **Frontend** | Angular 17 (standalone components, signals) | `http://localhost:4200` |
| **Backend** | Spring Boot 3.3.5 / Java 21 (layered REST API) | `http://localhost:8181` |
| **Database** | MySQL 8 (schema `cinebook`) | `localhost:3306` |

In development the Angular dev server **proxies** every `/api/*` call to the backend
(`frontend/proxy.conf.json`), so the browser sees a single origin and CORS is only exercised
in non-proxied setups. The backend is still configured for CORS from `http://localhost:4200`.

```
┌──────────────┐   /api/** (proxied)   ┌────────────────────┐   JDBC   ┌──────────┐
│  Angular SPA │ ────────────────────► │  Spring Boot API   │ ───────► │  MySQL   │
│  :4200       │ ◄──────────────────── │  :8181             │ ◄─────── │  cinebook│
└──────────────┘     JSON + JWT        └────────────────────┘          └──────────┘
```

The backend is **stateless**: it keeps no server-side session. Every request must carry its own
proof of identity — a JWT in the `Authorization` header. This is the core of the auth design.

---

## 2. Backend layering (how one request travels)

Every API request passes through these layers in order:

```
HTTP request
   │
   ▼
[ Servlet / Tomcat ]
   │
   ▼
[ Spring Security filter chain ]   ← CORS check, then JwtAuthFilter validates the token
   │                                  and puts the caller's identity into the SecurityContext
   ▼
[ Controller ]   (@RestController)  ← maps URL + verb, validates request body (@Valid)
   │
   ▼
[ Service ]      (@Service)         ← business logic, @Transactional boundaries
   │
   ▼
[ Repository ]   (JpaRepository)    ← Spring Data generates SQL
   │
   ▼
[ MySQL ]
```

Cross-cutting:
- **`GlobalExceptionHandler`** (`@RestControllerAdvice`) converts thrown exceptions into clean
  JSON error responses with the right HTTP status.
- **`SecurityConfig`** decides which URLs are public vs. protected.

Key backend packages (`backend/src/main/java/com/cinebook/`):

```
config/      SecurityConfig, CorsConfig
security/    JwtService, JwtAuthFilter, AuthPrincipal
controller/  AuthController
service/     AuthService
repository/  UserRepository, BookingRepository, BookingSeatRepository, … (8 total)
entity/      User, Booking, BookingSeat, Show, Movie, Theater, … + enums
dto/         LoginRequest, RegisterRequest, RegisterAdminRequest, AuthResponse
exception/   ApiException, GlobalExceptionHandler
```

## 3. Feature: JWT Authentication

### 3.1 What changed vs. before

| Before | Now |
|--------|-----|
| Passwords stored in **plaintext** | Passwords **BCrypt-hashed** (`$2a$10$…`, 60 chars) |
| No Spring Security | **Spring Security** filter chain guards the API |
| Identity faked via `X-User-Id` / `X-Role` headers (unverified — anyone could impersonate anyone) | Identity proven by a **signed JWT** the server issues and verifies |
| Frontend `identity.interceptor` | Frontend `auth.interceptor` sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |

### 3.2 The token

A JWT minted by `JwtService.generateToken(user)`:
- **subject** = username
- **claims** = `userId`, `role` (`USER`/`ADMIN`), `theaterId`
- **issuedAt / expiration** = now … now + 24h (`app.jwt.expiration-ms = 86400000`)
- **signature** = HMAC using the secret in `app.jwt.secret`

Because it is signed, the server can trust its contents without a database lookup or a session.

### 3.3 Registration flow

`POST /api/auth/register` (regular user) or `POST /api/auth/register-admin` (theater owner).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as Angular (register.ts)
    participant AS as auth.service.ts
    participant SEC as Spring Security chain
    participant C as AuthController
    participant SVC as AuthService
    participant ENC as BCryptPasswordEncoder
    participant JWT as JwtService
    participant DB as MySQL

    UI->>AS: register({username, password})
    AS->>SEC: POST /api/auth/register  (no token yet)
    Note over SEC: /api/auth/** is permitAll → passes straight through
    SEC->>C: dispatch
    C->>SVC: register(request)  (@Valid checked first)
    SVC->>SVC: ensureUsernameAvailable()
    SVC->>ENC: encode(password)
    ENC-->>SVC: "$2a$10$…"
    SVC->>DB: INSERT users (username, hash, role=USER)
    SVC->>JWT: generateToken(user)
    JWT-->>SVC: signed JWT
    SVC-->>C: AuthResponse{id, username, role, theaterId, token}
    C-->>AS: 201 Created + JSON
    AS->>AS: persist user (incl. token) to localStorage
    AS-->>UI: navigate to "/"
```

`registerAdmin` does the same but also creates a `Theater` row and links it back to the admin
(`user.theaterId`). The response carries the token, so a freshly registered user is **immediately
logged in** — no second round-trip.
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as Angular (login.ts)
    participant AS as auth.service.ts
    participant C as AuthController
    participant SVC as AuthService
    participant ENC as BCryptPasswordEncoder
    participant JWT as JwtService
    participant DB as MySQL

    UI->>AS: login({username, password})
    AS->>C: POST /api/auth/login (public)
    C->>SVC: login(request)
    SVC->>DB: findByUsername(username)
    DB-->>SVC: User (with stored hash)
    SVC->>ENC: matches(rawPassword, storedHash)
    
    alt password correct
        ENC-->>SVC: true
        SVC->>JWT: generateToken(user)
        JWT-->>SVC: Token
        SVC-->>C: AuthResponse{… , token}
        C-->>AS: 200 OK
        AS->>AS: store user+token in localStorage; set currentUser signal
    else password wrong / user missing
        ENC-->>SVC: false (or DB returns empty)
        SVC-->>C: throw ApiException.unauthorized(...)
        C-->>AS: 401 Unauthorized
        AS-->>UI: show "Invalid username or password"
    end
```
Crucially, the server never compares plaintext — `passwordEncoder.matches()` re-hashes the
submitted password and compares hashes. (This is why the legacy plaintext accounts can no longer
log in and the dev data must be reset.)

### 3.5 Authenticated request flow (the heart of JWT)

Once logged in, **every** subsequent API call carries the token and is validated by the filter
chain before reaching any controller.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as Angular component
    participant AI as auth.interceptor.ts
    participant EI as error.interceptor.ts
    participant CORS as CORS filter
    participant JF as JwtAuthFilter
    participant SC as SecurityContext
    participant AZ as Authorization rules
    participant CTRL as Controller

    UI->>AI: http.get("/api/...")
    AI->>AI: read token from AuthService.token()
    AI->>EI: clone request + header Authorization: Bearer <token>
    EI->>CORS: forward
    CORS->>JF: (origin allowed)
    JF->>JF: read "Authorization: Bearer", JwtService.parse(token)
    alt token valid
        JF->>SC: set Authentication(principal=AuthPrincipal, authority=ROLE_USER/ADMIN)
        JF->>AZ: continue chain
        AZ->>CTRL: request authenticated → dispatch
        CTRL-->>UI: 200 + data
    else token missing/expired/tampered
        JF->>SC: leave context empty
        AZ-->>EI: 401 (AuthenticationEntryPoint)
        EI->>EI: status==401 → AuthService.logout() + router → /login
    end
```

What each piece does:

- **`auth.interceptor.ts`** — attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to outgoing requests
  (no-op if logged out).
- **CORS** (`CorsConfig` → `CorsConfigurationSource` bean) — wired into the security chain via
  `http.cors()`, allows `localhost:4200` with credentials.
- **`JwtAuthFilter`** (`OncePerRequestFilter`, runs **before** `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`)
  — extracts the bearer token, calls `JwtService.parse()` to verify signature + expiry, builds an
  `AuthPrincipal(userId, username, role, theaterId)`, and stores it in the `SecurityContext` with a
  `ROLE_USER` / `ROLE_ADMIN` authority. Invalid tokens leave the context empty (no exception thrown
  there).
- **`SecurityConfig`** — `/api/auth/**` is `permitAll`; everything else is `authenticated()`.
  Unauthenticated calls to protected URLs hit the `AuthenticationEntryPoint`, which returns a clean
  **401** (not a login redirect). `@EnableMethodSecurity` allows future `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")`
  on individual endpoints.
- **`error.interceptor.ts`** — on any **401**, it clears the stored session and routes to `/login`
  (the client-side equivalent of "your token expired, sign in again").

### 3.6 Frontend session & route protection

- **`AuthService`** holds `currentUser` as an Angular **signal**, restored from `localStorage`
  (`cinebook.user`) on load, so a page refresh keeps you logged in. Derived signals: `isLoggedIn`,
  `isAdmin`, and `token` (used by the interceptor).
- **Route guards** (`app.routes.ts`):
  - `authGuard` → protects `/` (home); redirects to `/login` if not logged in.
  - `adminGuard` → ready for admin-only routes (`isAdmin`).
- **Logout** clears `localStorage` and the signal; guards then block protected routes.

```
/login, /register   → public
/                   → authGuard (must be logged in)
**                  → redirect to /
```

## 4. Feature: Partial-cancellation schema

### 4.1 The problem it solves

Originally a booking stored its seats as a single CSV string (`Booking.seats = "A1,A2,B5"`) and
its status was all-or-nothing (`CONFIRMED` / `CANCELLED`). There was no way to cancel **one** seat
out of several. We normalized the data so each seat is individually addressable.

### 4.2 New / changed schema

**New entity `BookingSeat`** → table `booking_seats` (one row per booked seat):

| column | type | purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `id` | bigint PK | |
| `booking_id` | bigint | FK → `bookings.id` (plain column, matching the project's no-`@ManyToOne` convention) |
| `seat_label` | varchar(10) | e.g. `"A1"` |
| `price` | decimal(10,2) | per-seat price → enables **per-seat refund math** |
| `status` | enum(`BOOKED`,`CANCELLED`) | current state of *this* seat |
| `cancelled_at` | datetime | when this seat was cancelled (nullable) |

**Enum changes:**
- `BookingStatus`: `CONFIRMED, PARTIALLY_CANCELLED, CANCELLED` (added the middle value).
- New `SeatStatus`: `BOOKED, CANCELLED`.

**`Booking` entity:** `seats` (CSV) is kept as the **immutable original snapshot** of what was
booked; the `BookingSeat` rows are now the **authoritative current state**. `refundAmount` and the
booking-level `status` will be recomputed from the seat rows when the cancellation logic is built.

**New repository** `BookingSeatRepository`: `findByBookingId`, `findByBookingIdAndStatus`,
`findByBookingIdInAndStatus` (the last supports future show-level seat-availability checks).

Spring/Hibernate auto-applies this schema on startup (`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`) — no
manual migration scripts.

### 4.3 How a future cancellation will flow (data model is ready; logic not yet built)

This is the intended flow the schema now supports — included so the design rationale is clear:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as Angular (My Bookings)
    participant API as BookingController (future)
    participant SVC as BookingService (future)
    participant BS as BookingSeatRepository
    participant B as BookingRepository

    UI->>API: PATCH /api/bookings/42/seats/cancel  body: ["A1"]
    API->>SVC: cancelSeats(bookingId=42, ["A1"], caller)
    SVC->>BS: findByBookingIdAndStatus(42, BOOKED)
    SVC->>BS: mark seat "A1" → CANCELLED, set cancelled_at
    SVC->>SVC: refund += seat.price
    SVC->>B: if all seats cancelled → status=CANCELLED<br/>else → status=PARTIALLY_CANCELLED
    SVC-->>API: updated booking
    API-->>UI: 200 + remaining active seats + refund total
```

Because each seat carries its own `price` and `status`, cancelling `"A1"` only touches that one
row, the refund is exactly that seat's price, and the parent booking flips to
`PARTIALLY_CANCELLED` until the last seat is gone.

> **Out of scope for now:** Stripe / payment-gateway integration and the booking & cancellation
> *business logic* (controllers/services) were intentionally deferred. The per-seat `price` +
> `Booking.refundAmount` fields are deliberately retained so a payment gateway can later issue
> partial refunds seat by seat.

---

## 5. End-to-end example: a logged-in user lists their bookings

Putting every layer together for one real request (`GET /api/bookings/mine`, illustrative):

1. **Component** calls `bookingService.mine()` → Angular `HttpClient`.
2. **`auth.interceptor`** adds `Authorization: Bearer eyJ…`.
3. **Proxy** forwards `:4200/api/...` → `:8181/api/...`.
4. **CORS filter** allows the origin.
5. **`JwtAuthFilter`** verifies the token, sets `AuthPrincipal{userId=6, role=USER}` in the
   `SecurityContext`.
6. **Authorization rules** see the request is authenticated → allow.
7. **Controller** reads the caller via `@AuthenticationPrincipal AuthPrincipal` (so the user can
   only ever query *their own* `userId` — identity comes from the verified token, never from a
   client-supplied header).
8. **Service** calls `bookingRepository.findByUserIdOrderByBookingDateDesc(6)` and, per booking,
   `bookingSeatRepository.findByBookingId(...)` for live seat state.
9. **Repository → MySQL** runs the SQL; rows map back to entities.
10. **Response** serialized to JSON → travels back up. If the token had been invalid, step 5 would
    have produced a **401**, and **`error.interceptor`** would have logged the user out.

## 6. Verification performed

The implementation was tested against the running backend + MySQL:

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Register → returns JWT | ✅ 194-char signed token |
| Login → returns JWT | ✅ |
| Protected endpoint **without** token | ✅ 401 |
| Protected endpoint **with** token | ✅ passes the security filter |
| Login with **wrong** password | ✅ 401 |
| Stored password format | ✅ BCrypt `$2a$10$…` (60 chars) |
| `booking_seats` table created | ✅ with `status enum('BOOKED','CANCELLED')` |
| `bookings.status` enum | ✅ now includes `PARTIALLY_CANCELLED` |
